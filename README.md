# Sentiment Analysis

**Project Description:**
This repository contains code for building a sentiment analysis model to classify product reviews into positive or negative sentiments. The model is based on natural language processing techniques and uses the TF-IDF technique for feature extraction.

**Dataset and Preparation:**
The "Product Reviews" dataset contains text reviews for various products along with their corresponding sentiment labels (positive or negative). The dataset is provided as a CSV file named product_reviews.csv.

**Data Preparation Steps:**

1. Load the dataset into a pandas DataFrame using `pd.read_csv()`.

2. Preprocess the text data by removing punctuation, converting text to lowercase, and tokenization.

3. Transform the preprocessed text data into numerical feature vectors using the TF-IDF technique.

Conclusion:
The Sentiment Analysis project provides a reliable model for classifying product reviews into positive or negative sentiments. By using the TF-IDF technique for feature extraction and a Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier, we can achieve accurate sentiment classification. This model enables businesses to understand customer sentiments better and make data-driven decisions to enhance their products and services.
